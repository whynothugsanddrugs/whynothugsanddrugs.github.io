I’m reaching out because we need to keep pushing each other to keep trying all that we can.<br><br>

As a friend (or friend of a friend), I think of us as being aligned in many ways, in which case, you may also have experienced shock, fear, anger, confusion, and hurt since Trump has been elected president. While it feels good to connect with those who think and feel like us, I find that this sense of unity fragments us from those with different perspectives, lives, and values, who in the abstract become “them”, “the other” , “the Red”, or “the Republicans”. Some friends have explicitly said that they just can’t speak to them. While that’s understandable for now, I wonder how we can keep trying to connect with those with different sets of circumstances, hopes, fears, perspectives, and politics. <br><br>
 
I’d like to challenge you to take a chance to connect deeply and differently as human beings. What do you think about gently reaching out to someone you’re feeling divided from this election year - by mailing a beautiful and kind surprise? Sometimes, we can connect more directly and with more presence as humans in a more intentional and creative space, perhaps through mail and through art. To help you get started, 13 artists got together to create reflective, connective, and inspiring arts for you to share. <br><br>
